# Activity: Popular Names


## Instructions 
- You will complete the Popular Names Activity found in the Data Computing eBook <https://dtkaplan.github.io/DataComputingEbook/project-popular-names.html#project-popular-names>  
    - You will choose at least five (5) names for the activity. They can be anynames you like.
    - The plot shown at the beginning is the **goal** for the end of the activity, **NOT** the first task in the activity.
- Complete the "activity-popular-names-template.Rmd" with your answers. 
  - Steps 2 and 6 do not require you to add anything to the RMarkdown document. Please actually write out these steps. Writing things out is an important step in learning coding.
